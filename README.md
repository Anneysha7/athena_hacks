# Project name

Welcome to our project <name>! This is our entry for the [2023 Athena Hacks Challenge](https://athenahacks2023.devpost.com/). We are participating in the **Best Beginner**, **Best Domain Name from Domain.com** and **Best Community Hack sponsored by Meta** categories.

## What <project name> is about
<Project name> generates poems and songs in your target language, as well as provides a translation. Through this project, we hope that people from across the world get to understand different cultural literacies by searching a theme of a song or a poem that they have in mind.
  
## How to use <project name>
Very easy! Simply go to <link>, enter a theme in the search bar, select the target language of your poem and a language you wish to see the poem to be translated to. Hit subit, then sit back and enjoy the cultural beauty of the words that appear in front of you.
  
## Inspiration
"Last year, I met some amazing people at university. One of them came on exchange for a semester and the other would be graduating the next year. We had the best time together, and since all of us came from different cultures, we wrote poems with a painting as parting gifts." For this hackathon, we have observed that our unity comes from diverse cultures and languages. Therefore, [project name] was built to celebrate each others' culture, identity and diversity using memorable poems and songs. We hope that these poems and songs spark curiosity in people's cultures and they grow more understanding of each other. 
Poems and songs, however, can be a little hard for some people to find. Be it for a friend's birthday, ice breaker events or parting gifts, we hope that [project name] helps create valuable moments.
  
## How [project name] was built

1. HTML and CSS
  
2. APIs - We used OpenAI API for generating poems and songs.
  
3. Flask - We used Flask to integrate the front end and back end into one whole, working unit.
  
## Challenges we ran into
We stretched ourselves out of ur comfort zones for this project. We were new to website building, and had never used APIs before. As a result, we ran into several errors, which we have been able to successfully debug by working together and reading guides on the internet. Since this project marked several firsts for us in terms of technologies used, we were cosniderably slowed down as we had to read lots of documentation and trials before getting to the actual project.
